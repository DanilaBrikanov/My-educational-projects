This repository contains my projects written in Python, which I created to study. This particular repository was created for small projects.

guess_number.py - code that guesses a number, and you have to guess it.
rps.py - rock, paper, scissors.
pws_gen.py - password generator.

----- Required software: Python 3.12.7; Matplotlib 3.8.3; Pandas 2.2.2; NumPy 24.2.
